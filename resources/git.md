This document is not for everyone. This is prepared for those who are not familiar with git, but need to use git to work with Dr. Kwon. Of course there will be some learning curve, but you will like it.

STOM Group uses [GitHub](https://github.com) for writing research papers together and developing software. Visit [the STOM-Group account page](https://github.com/STOM-Group).

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system. Watch [these videos](http://git-scm.com/videos).

## Instructions to STOM Group members
1. Create an account using your `.edu` email address and request an education pack at [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).
2. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
3. Email Dr. Kwon your GitHub account name. He'll add you to the GitHub group.

You're now ready. Learn how to do the following tasks.

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop/) this [SandBox](https://github.com/STOM-Group/SandBox) repository to your local desktop.
2. [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/creating-a-branch-for-your-work/).

## Resolving Conflicts
1. Commit your changes. Push will be rejected if your commit has some conflicts with the remote files.
2. <em>Pull</em> the remote to your local. It will identify conflicts.
3. Resolve the conflicts <em>manually</em>. Open the conflicting file from your local folder.Â There will be something like  `<<<<<<< HEAD`. Edit those parts as you like. (Do NOT use automatic merge tools such as 'Resolve using Mine' and Resolve using Theirs'. I think it is too dangerous. Do it manually.)
4. <em>Commit</em> your resolved clean changes.
5. <em>Push</em> them.
6. Check if everything is okay and delete `.orig` files, if any, in your local folder. (Don't commit/push `.orig` files.)
