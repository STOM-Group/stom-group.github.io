<h1>Read a Graduate School Survival Guide</h1>
Stop by <a href="http://stom.chkwon.net/resources/survival-guides/graduate-school-guide/#General_Graduate_School_Survival_Guide">this collection of survival guides</a>, finish reading at least one survival guide. If you can't decide which, read <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/157012-phds-from-the-facultys-perspective/fulltext">this article</a>.

<h1>How to Use LaTeX</h1>
LaTeX is a powerful and useful typesetting tool for any writing. LaTeX is especially helpful for academic writings.

I strongly encourage any graduate student in engineering, especially operations research, to learn how to use LaTeX. To begin your learning, you can simply google 'LaTeX', or start with <a title="LaTeX" href="http://stom.chkwon.net/resources/computer-help/latex/">my guide</a>.

<h1>How to Search Journal Papers</h1>
Of course, there are many ways to do this. Here is how I do it.
<div></div>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <a title="" href="http://scholar.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a>, and search with the <em>article title</em>. Sometimes it is helpful to add 'University of South Florida' (or your institution) to Library Links in <a title="" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_preferences?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;output=search" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar Preferences</a>. If USF has a subscription directly through the journal publisher, you will likely be able to access the article in the publisher's website. However, sometimes, USF has a subscription to non-publisher services; try Step 2.</li>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://www.lib.usf.edu" target="_blank">USF Libraries</a>, search the article in the 'Articles' search box. Check the 'Scholarly/Peer-Reviewed Articles only' box. For older papers, USF may not have subscriptions; try Step 3.</li>
	<li>Just Google the article. You may find a working draft version of the article.</li>
	<li>See if USF Libraries has a hard copy of the article.</li>
	<li>If anything does not work, go to <a title="" href="http://www.lib.usf.edu/ill/" rel="nofollow">ILLiad</a> to request a copy of the article from non-USF sources. ILLiad is an interlibrary loan service. After several days, you will likely receive a scanned PDF of the article.</li>
	<li>You may send a <em>polite</em> email to the author requesting a copy. The author may send you a working draft version.</li>
</ol>
