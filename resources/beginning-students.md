## Read a Graduate School Survival Guide
Stop by [this collection of survival guides](/resources/graduate-school-guides), finish reading at least one survival guide. If you can't decide which, read [this article](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/157012-phds-from-the-facultys-perspective/fulltext). Read it three times. Read it every month. 


## How to Use LaTeX
LaTeX is a powerful and useful typesetting tool for any writing. LaTeX is especially helpful for academic writings.

I strongly encourage any graduate student in engineering, especially operations research, to learn how to use LaTeX. To begin your learning, you can simply google 'LaTeX', or start with [my guide](/latex).


## How to Search Journal Papers
Of course, there are many ways to do this. Here is how I do it.

1. Go to [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), and search with the <em>article title</em>. Sometimes it is helpful to add 'University of South Florida' (or your institution) to Library Links in [Google Scholar Preferences](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_preferences?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;output=search). If USF has a subscription directly through the journal publisher, you will likely be able to access the article in the publisher's website. However, sometimes, USF has a subscription to non-publisher services; try Step 2.
2. Go to [USF Libraries](http://www.lib.usf.edu), search the article in the 'Articles' search box. Check the 'Scholarly/Peer-Reviewed Articles only' box. For older papers, USF may not have subscriptions; try Step 3.
3. Just Google the article. You may find a working draft version of the article.
4. See if USF Libraries has a hard copy of the article.
5. If anything does not work, go to [ILLiad](http://www.lib.usf.edu/ill/) to request a copy of the article from non-USF sources. ILLiad is an interlibrary loan service. After several days, you will likely receive a scanned PDF of the article.
6. You may send a *polite* email to the author requesting a copy. The author may send you a working draft version.



## How to Code in the Julia Language

Julia is a convenient computer language for scientific computing tasks such as numerical optimization, statistical analysis, and algorithm implementation. Any other languages, like C/C++, Java, Python, and MATLAB, are also fine, but I just find Julia handy, powerful, and interesting.

Read this [Julia guide for operations research](/julia).
