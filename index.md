The <strong>STOM Group</strong> is a research group led by <a href="http://www.chkwon.net" target="_blank">Dr. Changhyun Kwon</a> focusing on <strong>service and transportation operations management</strong> in the Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering at the University of South Florida. We seek to improve the operations of various service and transportation systems. In particular, we are interested in how we should determine prices for services under competition and uncertainty to maximize revenue.

The current research areas are risk management in hazardous materials (hazmat) transportation, infrastructure planning for electric vehicles, operational and strategic planning for bike-sharing systems, and modeling interaction between human and road networks. We mainly use various methods and techniques in operations research and optimization.

[We are looking for new students to join the group!](position)
